      <p>
        I&apos;m Neville Parmar from Union City, NJ, and I&apos;m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Business Administration at Saint Peter&apos;s University. 
        My coursework covers everything from programming and machine learning to business strategy and management, giving me a well-rounded foundation in both tech and business. I&apos;ve spent a couple of 
        years working as a Real Estate Agent at Howard Hanna Rand Realty, where I managed the entire process of buying and selling properties. I helped clients navigate the complexities of real estate, 
        drafted contracts to protect their interests, and worked closely with other professionals to ensure smooth transactions. I also developed and executed marketing strategies to maximize exposure 
        and sales, staying on top of market trends and regulations to give my clients the best advice possible. On the technical side, I&apos;ve worked on projects that include developing a FastAPI backend 
        for file uploads and interactions with the OpenAI API, creating a tool to summarize documents automatically, and building a personal website with Next.js to showcase my work. I&apos;m comfortable working 
        with a variety of programming languages and tools like Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, and more. In addition to my technical skills, I&apos;m fluent in Gujarati and Hindi, and I&apos;ve taken on leadership roles, 
        such as being a DECA Member and President. I&apos;ve also won a few awards, including first place in the RWC NJIT CSI competition and a leadership certificate. I&apos;m passionate about innovation and always 
        looking to bridge the gap between technology and business to create impactful solutions.
